This project was created in collaboration with Zisis Psalidas, as part of the 2024 Compilers course of the Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering.

Execute the command "python .\cutepyCompiler.py '.\cpy test.cpy'" to run the program, as output it produces the files inter.int for the intermediary code, symb.sym for the symbols table and fin.asm for the final code translated in assembly.
For more information on how this project was designed and how it works, read the REPORT.pdf.

NOTE: The final code which is produced in assembly is not finalised and needs more work in order to produce 100% correct results.
